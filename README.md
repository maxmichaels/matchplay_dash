## Matchplay dashboard

The motivation behind this project is to create a large, auto-updating, easy to read dashboard to be used on-location on large TVs/displays during pinball series/tournaments which use [matchplay.events](https://matchplay.events) as a score tracking system. Feel free to branch/modify/make pull requests and also feel free to use the/test running version [here](https://matchplay-dash.vercel.app/)

## About

The app is written using the [next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs) framework and is running on [vercel](https://vercel.com/).
